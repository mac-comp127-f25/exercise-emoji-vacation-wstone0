## Checklist

### Correctness

- [x] Image background shows trees 60% of the time, and mountains 50% of the time (mountains and trees may both appear in one image)

- [x] Each emoji in the family is randomly selected, based on your implementation of `createRandomEmoji()`
- [x] When run, your program iterates through an endless slideshow of these emoji photos, each with randomized backgrounds and emoji styles
  - [x] There is a pause for three seconds on each image so that a viewer may enjoy the slideshow!
- [ ] (Optional) Additional randomly-selected background scenery
- [ ] (Optional) A dark transition between each slide of the slideshow
- [x] (Optional) Child and adult emojis are shown in a random order
- [ ] (Optional) Modify the background to include multiple times of day in the random scenery

## Reflection

Briefly reflect in writing on your experience solving this exercise. Just a
sentence or two in response to each question is plenty.

**What did you miss? What did you wish you did better?**
I didn't catch anything that I missed, but I do wish I had a little more time to test exactly the values I had to estimate (# of trees, height of mountains, etc.).

**What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?**
I had a hard time finding the documentation, because I'm used to just looking up commands from the terminal. But then when I realized the problem was that it was a Mac-specific package, I thought to look on the course website.

**What is something that was interesting or exciting, or a lesson you learned from this experience that you want to remember?**
Graphics have always seemed very hard to work with to me, and there still was a lot provided for us in this assignment, but it definitely was easier than I was expecting to make a decent-looking animation.
